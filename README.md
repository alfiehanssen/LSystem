# LSystem

This repo contains a framework and demo app that can be used to procedurally generate paintings using [LSystems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system). 

It is a rapid prototype assembled over the course of 3 days for the first ever "Vimeo Jam" (March 2016).

Here are a few paintings that the system generated:

## TODO

- Refine the LSystem rules to more closely represent decisions one might make when manually creating an abstract painting.
